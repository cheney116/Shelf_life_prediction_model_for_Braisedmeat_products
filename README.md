# Shelf-life-prediction-model-for-Braisedmeat-products

This project integrates machine learning algorithms and text mining technology into the research on the shelf life prediction of sauced and Braised meat products. Based on the original data collection, through machine learning methods, with the shelf life as the target variable, a variety of features are used to construct a prediction model for sauced and braised meat products.
